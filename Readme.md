Ecommerce Dashboard Project
This project generates synthetic e-commerce transaction data and provides an interactive dashboard for visualizing various aspects of the data using Streamlit. The dashboard allows users to upload CSV files, inspect data, and visualize key metrics such as daily profit/loss, most popular products, and more.

Features
Generate Synthetic Data: Create a large CSV file with 100,000 rows of e-commerce transaction data, including fields such as order ID, customer name, product details, discounts, and more.
Streamlit Dashboard:
Upload and inspect the CSV file.
Visualize Daily Profit/Loss using a line chart.
Identify Most Popular Products using a bar chart.
Filter and display data based on Date Range.
View the filtered data in a table format.
Option to identify potential fraudulent orders (based on is_fraud field).
Requirements
Python 3.x
pip for package installation
Installation
Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ecommerce_dashboard
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Generate Synthetic Data:

Before running the Streamlit app, generate the synthetic e-commerce data by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/generate_data.py
This will generate a CSV file ecommerce_data.csv in the data/ folder.

Running the App
Once the synthetic data is generated, you can start the Streamlit app:

Start the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app/app.py
This will open the app in your default web browser, where you can:

Upload the ecommerce_data.csv or any other CSV file with the same format.
Filter the data by date range using the sidebar.
View Daily Profit/Loss as a line chart.
Visualize the Most Popular Products as a bar chart.
Inspect the filtered data in a table format.
Streamlit Dashboard Overview
Sidebar:

Date Range Filter: Select the date range to filter the data based on order_date.
Main Dashboard:

Daily Profit/Loss Chart: Displays daily profit/loss calculated by total_price - cost_price.
Most Popular Products: Displays a bar chart of the top 10 most popular products based on the number of sales.
Filtered Data Table: Displays the filtered dataset according to the selected date range.
Fraud Detection:

The is_fraud field in the dataset allows for the detection of potentially fraudulent orders. You can add additional filtering logic or features for better fraud detection in future updates.
Enhancements (Optional)
Fraud Detection: Implement more complex fraud detection models using machine learning algorithms.
Additional Filters: Add more filters for categories, coupon codes, or other fields.
Advanced Visualizations: Add more charts like pie charts, bar charts for discounts, and heatmaps for order distribution.
Project Future Improvements
Add an authentication system for secure access.
Improve fraud detection by identifying outliers or suspicious patterns.
Host the app using Streamlit Cloud or Heroku for public access."# ecommerce-dashboard"
